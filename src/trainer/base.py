        An object to gather statistics during training. It is an optional 
        parameter. The default `NOOPTrainerStats` will simply no-op on every 
        call used to gather statistical data.
    enable_checkpointing
        Whether or not to checkpoint the model.
    checkpoint_frequency
        The after how many steps a checkpoint is saved.

    Attributes
